<p>There are several disadvantages to seiza. For those who not accustomed to it, seiza can impose some strain on the knees and on the tendons at the front the ankle. It also doesn't provide the best platform for resting the hands. Personally, I find that my hands always want to slide down my thighs, which tends to pull my shoulders forward and down. This makes seiza less comfortable than some other positions that I prefer. Other people may not have this issue.</p>

<p>Sitting in a chair for meditation is a little bit different than sitting in a chair to eat or work or watch television. For one thing, when eating, working, or watching television, your attention is captured by some activity or stimulus, and so you are less attuned to the minor discomforts of your sitting position. In addition, when doing some activity, you have the option of fidgeting, squirming, moving around, and making minor adjustments here and there to redistribute your weight over time. All of this runs pretty much on autopilot. As a result, minor discomforts linger at the periphery of awareness, if they are even noticeable at all, and are relatively easy to manage.</p>

<p>By contrast, when meditating you want to sit very still with your mind focused on something static, and so you will be very aware of even the most minor sensations. You will also find that reclining with the back against a straight or hard rest tends to be a little uncomfortable. This may seem counter-intuitive, but most people eventually find that they are more comfortable sitting up straight without the use of a rest. This will be explained in more detail when discussing the upper body. However, for now, it is sufficient to note that, when sitting in a chair for meditation, it is better to sit toward the front part of the seat with you back off the rest.</p>


<p>The second key component to a comfortable meditation posture is a neutral chest. This was an element of meditation posture that eluded me for many years. Frankly, I am still not 100% confident I have it right.</p>

<p>Extending the back means relaxing the chest downward.  This may seem contrary the instructions that are given by some meditation teachers.  There is a trend in meditation posture instruction to tell the students to “open the chest” or “open the heart”, or even to gently lift the chest.  These instructions are well meaning but subtly misleading.  Without slumping, the chest must be relaxed  downward and inward.</p>

<p>The instruction to “open the chest” is not necessarily wrong.  It can be a helpful cue to roll back the shoulders, which creates a sense of openness in the chest (more on the shoulders in the next section).  However, many students, when being told to “open the chest”, will actually lift the chest upward rather than rolling the shoulders back.  This lifting of the chest upward is a common mistake that causes a lot of tension in the middle back.  Lifting the chest can also distort or impinge on the small valve at the entrance of the stomach, resulting in acid reflux and heartburn.xiv</p>

<p>Instead of lifting the chest and puffing it forward, one should instead allow the chest to relax downward, not in an exaggerated way, not by slumping, but just by letting it gently release down.  This allows the muscles of the lower and middle back to relax.</p>

<p>There are a few different exercises or cues for feeling the sensation of a relaxed chest and extended back.  Perhaps the easiest exercise is to place your fingers on the base of your xiphoid process, the small bone at the base of your sternum.  Feel the sternum raise as you lift your chest and lower as you relax it down.  When the chest is relaxed, the xiphoid process tucks slightly inward.</p>

<p>Another exercise for getting a feel for relaxing the chest is to lift your arms overhead and reach for the ceiling.  Feel the sensation of the back elongating as you reach upward.  Then, while keeping the back in that position, put the arms down.</p>

<p>Another mental cue to use is to feel yourself “thickening” through the waist.  As the chest relaxed downward the muscles of the mid and lower back seem to widen outward and to thicken like the base of a tree, which must have the strength to support the weight of the branches and crown.</p>

<p>Another feeling to look for is the shape of your lower-to-mid back.  As you lift the chest, the lower-to-mid back will seem to tighten and elongate upward as it squeezes forward.  As you lower the chest, the lower-to-mid back loosen and widen outward.  </p>

<p>Another way to feel this adjustment is, if you are sitting on your seat with forward pelvic tilt, you will notice that you have some “arch” in your lower back.  As you lower the chest, this will reduce the amount of the arch and will move it down your back toward the very bottom of the spine.  The curvature will be shorter and more concentrated near the tailbone.</p>

<p>Finally, while sitting with an anteverted pelvis, you can try reaching with your arms overhead.  Try to reach as high as you can.  You will probably instinctively raise your chest.  Now, with your arms overhead, try to rotate your rib cage forward, and see if you can get your fingers just an inch or two higher.  If you can feel just a little extra reach, then you should have successfully have lowered your chest without slumping.xv  This will result in an extended spine, and a relaxed back.  You can also try this reaching exercise while lying on the floor, just to get a feel for the extension of the spine.</p>
