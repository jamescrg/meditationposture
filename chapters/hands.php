<h1>Hand and Arm Placement</h1>

<p>The arms should hang as close to the body as possible.  The more the arms move away from the torso, the more they place a strain on the muscles of the back.  </p>

<p>There are many different way of positioning the arms.  I'll suggest three of them here.  First, you can place your hands in a “mudra” position in your the lap.  Second, you can  place the hands on the middle of the thighs.  Third, you can hold the hands in a mudra position at or about your navel.  </p>

<p>For those who are unfamiliar, the term “mudra” is Sanskrit for “gesture”.  It simply refers to a position of the hands.  Traditionally, in Hinduism and Buddhism the hands were placed in a position with symbolic significance.  </p>

<p>Probably the most common mudra today is colloquially called the “cosmic mudra”.  You can form the cosmic mudra by placing either hand in your lap facing upward.  Then place the other hand on top of it, also facing upward.  Tough the tips of your thumbs together to form a gentle oval. </p>

<p>It turns out that cosmic mudra is a very comfortable position for the hands over long periods of time, which is probably a key reason for its popularity.  In addition, because the thumbs rest very lightly against one another, this mudra can be a useful indicator of the quality of your posture.  If you find yourself off balance or starting slumping, the first sign of trouble may be a loss of tone or integrity in the shape of the mudra.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you the cosmic mudra annoying, you can just lay your hands in your lap, facing up, with one on top of the other.  Or you can just call it “making an oval”.  In this guide, our only concern is with getting comfortable.</p
<p>I personally prefer to hold my hands just below my belly button in the shape of the cosmic mudra.  I have a fairly long torso and find that laying my hands in my lap pulls my shoulders forward and out of the ideal alignment.  It may seem strange at first to hold the hands in the air unsupported, but there is surprisingly little effort involved.  The biceps can support the weight of the forearms and hands with no difficulty.  And, because the arms are close to the body, there is almost no extra load or strain on the back.  Moreover, because I usually sit in half-lotus, when my hands are in my lap, they are resting on my heel, which is an uneven surface, and thus my hands have a tendency to slide in one direction or another.  Simply holding my hands at my navel keeps my shoulders in line and eliminates the distraction of feeling my hands slide away.</p>

<p>I also find that placing the hands on the thighs tends to be a little uncomfortable.  This is because my hands always feel like they are either too close or too far away.  If they are too close, I end up resting some of my weight on the hands can cause cramping in my shoulders.  If they are too far away, the weight of my arms tends to pull my shoulders down and forward, again causing cramping in the shoulders.  However, I know of many people who are quite comfortable resting their hands on their thighs.</p>

<p>One other item of note: the higher the cushion, the more difficult it will be to rest the hands on the lap.  The lower the cushion, the easier.  On lower cushions, the angle of the legs and torso is closer to ninety degrees, and the hands can settle into the creases of the hip.  For this reason, it is easier to hold the hands in the lap when sitting in, for example, full lotus, as compared with, for another example, the Burmese position.</p>
