<h2>Extended Neck</h2>
<p>The neck can be a surprisingly complicated subject.  Some meditation teachers encourage practitioners to sit with their chin tucked in.xvi xvii  Others say that the chin should be neutral, and the eyes forward, so that the head is perfectly balanced on top of the spine.xviii  Some posture experts say that the head will not be balanced unless the chin is slightly down and the crown of the head pointed toward the ceiling.xix  </p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that when the head is ideally aligned, the chin will be gently tucked.  This avoids two potential mistakes.  First, many practitioners have a tendency to allow the head to drift forward, sticking out in front of the torso.  This actually causes the muscles in the back of the neck to contract to hold the eyes level.  Obviously, this add some stress to the muscles at the base of the head, and some tension in the back as the weight of the head levers forward.  Keeping the chin tucked engages the muscles at the front of the neck and helps prevent this forward drift.  This in turn makes the neck and back more comfortable. </p>
<p>Second, some people what to lift their chin and nose in a proud-looking pose.  This occurs when people are attempting to sit as tall as possible and lengthen through the spine.  Looking down the nose creates an instinctive sense of tallness or height.  The problem with this posture is that it tends to create tension in the back of the neck over time.  Tucking the chin eliminates the problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the instruction to tuck the chin can create a different problem, the drooping of the head.  When told to tuck the chin, some enthusiastic students have tendency to roll the head too far forward.  As one might imagine, this also can create some tension in the neck and back. </p>
<p>A common way of trying to encourage a tucked chin, without a drooping head, is to tell students to imagine they have a string attached to the crown of the head, drawing the head up toward the ceiling.  This is perhaps the best instruction a teacher can give when time is very limited for discussing posture, but this instruction can lead people to lift their chest while they are tucking their chin.  In addition, it is possible to tuck the chin too forcefully.</p>
<p>The key with the head and neck is lightly lower the chin and relax.  When the rest of the posture is sound, the head will balance comfortably in a natural position.  </p>
<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>
<p>Now try this.  Sit on a meditation seat of your choice, and position yourself as described above, with your pelvis tilted forward, chess lowered, shoulders open, hands and arms comfortably arranged, with your neck retracted and chin slightly down.  Now, hinging at your hips, lean slightly forward.  Then lean slightly back and then side to side.  Get a feel for your most vertical alignment.  Notice how, as you lean back, your abdominal muscles engage, and as you lean forward you back muscles engage.  Feel the muscles in your torso regulating tension up and down in response to the position of your chest in relation to your hips.  Search for a comfortable, vertical posture where everything is balanced.  Don't stress out about finding the perfect spot.  Just work your way into a natural, comfortable alignment.  Most likely, this will be just about as straight and vertical as possible.</p>
<p>I am also getting used to the idea that I should have a slight lean forward and my head should be slightly forward.  See Porter p. 241.</p>
<h1>Stating Options</h1>
<p>There are many options in seating, and the option one choses will depend largely on placement of the legs.</p>
<h2>Chair</h2>
<p>Chairs are an excellent way of sitting.  There is a variety of ways to sit comfortably in a chair for meditation.</p>
<h3>Reclining</h3>
<p>One can always sit in a recliner.  This is an important option for people who are elderly or who may have a back injury or other physical problem that prevents sitting up straight.</p>
<h3>The Towel Trick</h3>
<p>What I call the “towel trick” is a great way to convert a chair, effectively, into a meditation cushion.  Start with a chair that has a flat seat and a straight back, like a dining table chair.  Then take a standard bath towel and fold it in half.  Then fold it in half again, and then again and again.  With four folds, the towel should now form a tick pad.  You can place this in the middle of the chair and sit on the front of the pad.  If the pad slides around, you might want to get another towel, fold that three times, and place it on the seat.  Then place the original folded towel on top.  This can be useful way to have a way to sit when your cushion is unavailable.</p>
<h3>Chair with Zafu</h3>
<p>You can also combine a chair with a zafu (a thick cushion designed specifically for sitting and meditation, covered below).  Simply place the zafu on the chair and sit on top of the zafu.  It is helpful to sit toward the front of the zafu to allow the lower back to arch gently forward.</p>
<h3>Other Options with Cushions</h3>
<p>Some people prefer to place the zafu in the small of their back against the back rest.  Other people may use two zafus, one under the legs and another at the small of the back.  </p>
<h3>Specialty Chairs</h3>
<p>There are some specialty chairs that can be very useful for meditation.  Saddle chairs can provide excellent postural support with a variety of fine adjustments.  Kneeling chairs are also an excellent option, allowing a person essentially to sit in seiza with less strain on the knees.</p>
<h2>Seiza Bench</h2>
<p>The existence of the seiza bench is a testament to the popularity to sitting in seiza.  The name pretty much says it all.  It's a small bench for sitting in the seiza position.  </p>
<p>A seiza bench takes most of the weight of the body off the knees and increases the angle formed by the thighs and calves, thereby reducing the amount of quadriceps flexibility necessary for getting comfortable.  It also takes pressure off the tops of the feet.  Seiza benches are widely available for purchase online.  There are tall benches, short benches, folding benches, curved benches, and many other options.  </p>
<h2>Zafu</h2>
<h3>A Quick Introduction</h3>
<p>A zafu is a round cushion for sitting, best known for its use in meditation.  The term “zafu” is Japanese and originally denotes the type of cushion used in Zen temples and meditation centers.  However, zafus are popular today in virtually all traditions of meditation.  For example, it is not uncommon to see zafus in Tibetan and Theravada meditation halls, secular meditation centers, or even Christian meditation retreats and workshops.  </p>
<p>I highly recommend investing in a zafu cushion.  An improvised cushion may be fine for a while (and I will discuss some options below), but it is difficult to replicate the support and comfort of a special-purpose sitting cushion.  Cushions are now widely available online at a relatively modest expense, and even an inexpensive cushion should last for decades.</p>
<h3>Varieties of Zafu</h3>
<p>With the modern popularity of the zafu, there are now many varieties available: all shapes and sizes and types of filling.  Traditionally, zafus were stuffed with reedmace (cattail) down.  Today they are generally stuffed with either kapok (cotton-like material) or buckwheat hulls (the outer caff of buckwheat grains).  </p>
<p>Kapok zafus tend to be thicker, allowing you to sit up higher.  Buckwheat hull zafus tend to be more malleable, and they generally do not compress over time.  Some initial compression may be noticeable as the hulls “settle”, but this can be eliminated by “fluffing” the cushion.  </p>
<p>I'm inclined to recommend the buckwheat hull zafu.  This is the type of cushion I have used for a few years, and it seems to be the most popular.  It is easy to adjust the thickness and firmness of the buckwheat hull zafu by adding or removing some hulls.  As a result, this is a good option for a beginning meditator.  </p>
<p>The kapok zafu is also an excellent choice.  From what I understand, many experienced zen practitioners may prefer kapok for its softness.  That being said, most kapok cushions I have seen on the market are quite thick compared to what I've seen my local zen center.  I'm not sure if this is due to compression over time; from what I understand, kapok does not compress as easily as cotton.  Need to talk to ASZC about this.</p>
<p>There are also more contemporary materials available.  I am aware of a few different sources that sell zafus with memory foam.  However, these tend to be more expensive, and I am uncertain as the advantages.</p>
<h3>Zafu Height</h3>
<p>The size and height of the cushion will depend largely on how the legs are arranged. A person sitting in seiza, using a cushion between the legs, will probably want a larger, fuller cushion. A person sitting cross-legged will want a fairly high cushion.  A person sitting Burmese will want a high or medium height cushion.  A person sitting in quarter lotus will want a medium to low cushion.  A person sitting in half or full lotus may want something quite thin.</p>
<p>Another variable is a person's height.  Taller people tend to prefer higher cushions.  I suspect this is because a longer torso means a longer spinal column, which requires just a little more support in order to maintain its ideal vertical alignment.</p>
<p>In general, a higher cushion will do a better job of providing support for the lower back.  However, once the optimal height has been reached, additional cushion height become superfluous, and only contributes to instability.  In this respect, finding an optimal height for the cushion is one of the first and most important adjustments you can make.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Zafu Height</h3>
<p>A great way to experiment with different cushion heights is to place a folded towel under a buckwheat hull zafu.  My zafu at home, which is just a typical buckwheat hull zafu purchased from a major online vendor, is 5 inches tall (12 centimeters) when smoothed flat (measuring from the floor to the top of front edge of the cushion).  If I fold a towel and place it underneath the cushion, I get 7 inches (17 centimeters) of height.  If I fold a second towel and place it under the first, I get about 9 inches (21 centimeters) of height.  I can further affect the height by fluffing the zafu, which gets me another half inch, or by wiggling my buttocks around to compress the cushion into a wedge shape.  That usually reduces the height of the front size by an inch or two.  </p>
<h3>Using a Zabuton</h3>
<p>A zabuton is a wide rectangular pad that is often used under a zafu to provide comfort for the legs.  A zabuton can be useful on hardwood or tile floors.  It is not necessary to use a zabuton on carpet.  If you are tall and want to use a zabuton, I'd look for an extra-large version, so your knees don't hang off the edges.</p>
<h3>Positioning on the Zafu</h3>
<p>You should sit on the front of the zafu.  There is room for experimentation here.  With a higher zafu, you may sit more toward the center.  With a lower zafu, you may want to sit more toward the front, near the very front edge.  If you sit too far back on the zafu, it will not serve its essential purpose of supporting the natural curvature of your low back.  In addition, sitting too far back may cause the front of the zafu to place pressure on the sciatic nerve of one or both legs.  This may in turn have the effect of putting your lower legs to sleep.  On the other hand, if you sit too far forward, you may start to feel uneven, tilted to one side.  Sitting to far back on the zafu may also have the effect of tilting you too far forward, which can cause your back to “sway” or “overarch”, in other words, to curve too much and too high up into the mid back.</p>
<h3>Improvised Seating</h3>
<p>If for any reason you simply cannot obtain a zafu, or if you are traveling and don't have access to one, there are many ways to improvise a meditation cushion.  Folded blankets are an excellent choice.  Wool blankets are particularly good for this purpose, because they hold their shape well and tend not to compress as much as cotton or soft polyester.  Folded terrycloth towels can also serve as a cushion.  You can stack up some books and cover them with a towel.  You can use a yoga block, or a yoga block and a hand towel folded on top.  You can also sit on the edge of a bed or on the front edge of a chair or couch.  </p>
<h1>Some Common Combinations</h1>
<h3>Option 1: Upright in a Chair</h3>
<p>Find a firm chair with a relatively flat seat and straight back.  Place a folded towel on the seat if necessary to provide some cushion.  Place another folded towel on top of the first to provide some support for your backside, so as to facilitate some anterior pelvic tilt.  Sit toward the front of the chair, and feel the bones of your pelvis, the sitz bones (or just in front of the sitz bones), firmly pressing into the seat.  Align your chest, shoulders, and head as described in “The Upper Body”, above.  Rest your hands on your thighs.</p>
<h3>Option 2: Seiza</h3>
<p>Borrow a seiza bench or buy one online.  Or turn a zafu on its side and place it between your legs.  If using a zafu, sit toward the front of the cushion, and try to position yourself so that your pelvis is tilting forward.  Align your chest, shoulders, and head as described in “The Upper Body”, above.  Rest your hands on your thighs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If seiza over-stretches the tops of your feet, you might get a zabuton and place your bench or cushion on top.  Then sit so that your feet hang off the back of the zabuton.</p>
<h3>Option 3: Cross-Legged</h3>
<p>Get a high cushion, or get an average-height cushion and raise it with towels.  See “Adjusting Zafu Height” above.  Sit cross-legged toward the front.  Align your chest, shoulders, and head as described in “The Upper Body”, above.  Rest your hands in your lap or on your thighs.</p>
<h3>Option 4: Burmese</h3>
<p>Get a high cushion, or get an average-height cushion and raise it with towels.  See “Adjusting Zafu Height” above.  Sit in Burmese toward the front of the cushion.  Align your chest, shoulders, and head as described in “The Upper Body”, above.  Hold your hands in the cosmic mudra at the level of your abdomen.</p>
<h3>Option 5: Lotus</h3>
<p>Get a lower or medium-height cushion.  Sit in a version of lotus of your choice (quarter, half, or full) toward the front of the cushion.  Align your chest, shoulders, and head as described in “The Upper Body”, above.  Hold your hands in the cosmic mudra at the level of your abdomen or resting in your lap.</p>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>
<p>How far back to sit on the cushion</p>
<p>Should the back be straight?</p>
<p>The back should be straight.  This means no slumping.  Pelvis tilted forward, chest relaxed, shoulders rotated back and relaxed.</p>
<p>Should the spine be straight like a stack of coins?</p>
<p>At one time, this was a useful metaphor for teaching people to sit with a straight back.  Today, it is confusing, because the anatomy of the spine is so widely understood, and the vertebrae do not sit straight.</p>
<p>Eyes open or closed?</p>
<p>Should I retract my shoulders?</p>
<p>Should my weight be over my sitz bones?</p>
<p>This can cause over-arching.  Might work well on a chair or bench.  Confusing on a zafu.</p>
