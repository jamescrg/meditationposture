<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>If you are eager to get started and would prefer not to wade through the rest of this site, try the following steps. But if the guidelines below don't work, don't immediately get discouraged. Explore the information provided here and see if you can find some ideas on how to make yourself more comfortable.</p>

<p>At minimum, you should also read the section on the <a href="back">lower back</a>. The central and most important principle of good posture is discussed in that section.</p>

    <li>Get a zafu (with buckwheat filling). You can buy one online. It's a round meditation cushion that looks like this:</li>

    <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/zafu-bw.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

    <li>Sit in a cross legged position on the front of the zafu. Allow your pelvis to tip forward, creating some curve in your lower back. Make sure both knees are on the floor. If your knees are floating, put some towels under your cushion to raise your hips higher than your knees. Or you can try placing cushions under your knees to relax the legs. Your setup should look something like this:</li>

    <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/sit-lotus-quarter.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

    <li>Place your hands in your lap. Make an oval like this:</li>

    <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/hands-mudra-cosmic.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

    <li>Try to feel the bones of your lower pelvis (there are two of them, called the sitz bones), where they contact the cushion. Your center of balance should be directly over, or just in front of, your sitz bones.

    <li>Sit up straight and press your head gently reach toward the ceiling. This is a light effort. </li>

    <li>Keep your chest neutral. Do not consciously lift your sternum.</li>

    <li>For now, don't worry about your shoulders.</li>

    <li>Bring your chin slightly down. Keep the back of your neck long. Here is a side view of how your alignment may look. Bear in mind that my posture may not be perfect. My head is a bit forward.</li>

    <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/sit-lotus-half-side.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

    <li>Relax as much as possible. You will still need to expend some amount of muscular effort in sitting upright, but in due time you will grow accustomed to the position, and that sense of effort will become increasingly light.</li>

    <li>Establish a consistent and frequent stretching routine to cultivate more flexibility in your legs and hips, so that you can eventually move into more supportive positions, like half-lotus. Make sure whatever routine you're doing targets the quads, hip flexors, groin, glutes, and chest.</li>
