<h1>The Importance of Comfort</h1>

<p>There are two important points to be made about comfort. The first point is, the main objective of your meditation posture should be comfort.  While this may seem superficially obvious, there are at least a few people like myself who begin their experience with meditation with a mindset of perseverance.  They believe that learning to sit for long periods of time will require them to endure substnatial physical discomfort and they just need to tough it out.  Perhaps they think that learning to endure soreness and discomfort is an important part of training the mind.  Or perhaps they believe that the body just needs to be conditioned, the muscles in the back strengthened, before comfort can be attained.  </p>

<p>In my experience, starting out with the attitude of perseverance was not very helpful.  Usually, pain was a signal that I was doing something wrong with my posture, and by ignoring the pain I only caused a lot of distraction and, no surprise, more pain.  Ignoring discomfort can lead to chronic problems, like inflammation, tendonitis, muscle cramping, loss of mobility, and vulnerability to injury.  Postural discomfort has almost always been a persistent and significant disruption in my ability to focus and relax, a signal that something is awry.</p>

<p>The second point is, some types of discomfort should be tolerate. In those cases, the discomfort can either be ignored or made an integral part the meditation practice iteslf. The difference between discomfort that should be avoided and discomfort that should be tolerated is sometimes difficult to discern, but there are some helpful guidelines.</p>

<p>If the discomfort arises from muscular tension or cramping, it should be avoided. If the discomfort is in a joint, like the knee, or between two vertebrae in the spine, or deep in the lower back, it should be avoided. On the other hand, if the discomfort arises from the senses, such as an an itch here or there, an annoying noise, a cold temperature, or even muscular pain not associated with posture, it should generally be tolerated (within the constraints of common sense). </p>

<p>Finally, to the extent that the advice in this guide results in making you uncomfortable, please do whatever is necessary to place yourself in a relaxing and sustainable position.</p>
