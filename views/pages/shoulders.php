<h1>Open, Relaxed Shoulders</h1>
<p>The third key element of good meditation posture is to have open, relaxed shoulders.  This may seem difficult at first, because your shoulders may want to naturally round forward.  However, if the muscles of the chest are sufficiently relaxed, the shoulders will remain back.  </p>
<p>The important thing to understand here, is that the shoulder can and should open without lifting the chest.  This is one of the most common mistakes for beginning practitioners.  In order to bring the shoulders back, they will lift the chest up.  This does have the effect of rotating the shoulders back and it does produce the appearance to good posture.  However, it does not actually solve the underlying problem of slumped shoulders.</p>
<p>In order to bring the shoulders back, one should do a shoulder roll.  Lift the shoulders up, pull them back, and let them settle down.  Do all of this without lifting the chest.  Do not pull the shoulders down.  Do not try to hold the shoulders back.  Just let them rest in an open position.  It may take some time to get a feel for this, and the difference between slumped and open shoulders can feel quite subtle.  However, it does facilitate a more comfortable meditation posture.</p>
<p>It may be difficult at first to open the shoulders if the chest muscles are tight.  For this reason, I highly recommend doing the doorway stretch (see “Physical Conditioning”) every day until the chest becomes more open.  Thereafter, it may be helpful to do the doorway stretch periodically for maintenance.</p>
<p>One mistake to avoid is pulling the shoulders back and holding them back with effort.  For some people, particularly if their chest muscles are tight, this may seem like the only way to keep the shoulders back.  However, it is better to let the shoulders round than to hold them back with tension.  Instead of holding the shoulders back, one should focus on stretching out the chest.  In addition, it may be necessary to establish good alignment in spine before the shoulders can rest in an open position.  If the lower back is rounded then the shoulders will inevitably come forward.</p>
<p>Lastly, the shoulders should not be shrugged upward or pulled down.  They should simply “float” in their place.  Once they are rolled back, let them rest.  </p>
