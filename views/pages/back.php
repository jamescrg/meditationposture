<h1>The Lower Back</h1>

<h2>Forward Pelvic Tilt Supports the Lower Back</h2>

<p>Regardless of how the legs are positioned, the first and most important component of meditation posture is forward pelvic tilt. (Aitking 14, 15; Gokhale 20; Johnson 22; Porter 52; see also Sogen 37) With your knees positioned below your hips, you will have space for your pelvis to tilt forward. This brings the belly out and forward and creates some natural, healthy arch in the lower back. Without this forward pelvic tilt, comfort on a seat (without a back prop) is very difficult. Esther Gokhale provides a nice statement regarding the importance of forward pelvic tilt, what she calls "pelivc anteversion":</p>

<blockquote>Pelvic anteversion is the foundation of a healthy human frame, affecting the placement of every other part of the body. Today, many medical and fitness experts advise a ‘neutral’ pelvic position that is slightly (and sometimes extremely) tucked, or retroverted. A retroverted pelvis leads you into one of two postures: you can be upright, but your low back muscles will be tense; or you can relax, but your upper body will slump forward . . . Neither of these postures is healthy; both cause damage. (Gokhale 20)</blockquote>

<p>Having the pelvis tipped forward causes the belly to relax forward while the buttocks are pushed a little farther back. This relationship has been a central part of traditional posture instruction in zen monasteries, where monks sit for  hours at a time.</p>

<blockquote>The belly sticks out in front, while the rear sticks out behind. Katsuki Sekida, former resident adviser to the Diamond Sangha, once sent out New Year cards with the greeting, “Belly forward, buttocks back.” With the spine thus correctly positioned, all else follows . . . (Aitken 14,15)</blockquote>

<h2>A Cushion Provides Back Support</h2>

<p>The purpose of sitting on a cushion or other support during meditation is to achieve and maintain forward pelvic tilt. By sitting on the front of the cushion, we position ourselves on an inclined plane or a wedge that holds the back of the pelvis higher than the front. In the image below, you an clearly see how my knees are positioned lower than my hips, and my pelvis has tipped forward, allowing the lower back to assume its natural curvature, without the need for lumbar support.</p>

<p>In essence, the meditation cushion provides a measure of back support. By lifting the seat and propping the pelvis forward position, the cushion holds the lower spine in a lordotic (forward) curve. When one is positioned correctly on a cushion, it actually becomes somewhat of a challenge to round the lower back. This in turn supports the weight of the chest, shoulders, and head.</p>

<h2>Sit Toward the Front of the Cushion</h2>

<p>This is the reason why we are advised to sit on the forward portion of the cushion. Sitting toward the back of the cushion would be counterproductive, because it would cause the lower back to round. Sitting in the middle of the cushion would raise the body off the floor, provide a soft surface, and make room for the legs, but it wouldn't support the lower back by lifting the pelvis forward. On a high enough cushion, it would also have a tendency to tilt you forward, and to cause the back to “sway” (or arch excessively) the middle of your back. Sitting toward the front of the cushion, on the other hand, brings the upper body upright and shapes the lumbar curve lower toward the tailbone. This eliminates tension in the mid back and subtly brings the chest and head into better alignment over the hips. </p>
