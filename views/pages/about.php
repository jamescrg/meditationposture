<h1>About this Site</h1>

<p>

This website aims to help people who meditate find a comfortable posture. I am not an expert on posture, but I have read widely on the subject. I also have several years of experience in practicing meditation. During the first few years, I had some trouble with learning how to get comfortable, and I would like to help others avoid the difficulties that I initially experienced.

<h2>For Beginners</h2>

<p>

If you are new to meditation, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on taking the first steps on an extraordinary path. There are many benefits to meditation. Do not be deterred by your preliminary troubles. Stay determined and practice every day. The journey is well worth the time and effort.

<h2>A Note on Sources</h2>

<p>

Much of the information on this website has been gathered from books. A list of sources is linked in the sidebar, and may also be found <a href="sources">here</a>. Throughout this site, I use parenthetical references to cite to the sources in the list. These references use the last name of the author, followed by a page number.  For example, a citation to <i>Taking the Path of Zen</i> by Robert Aitken, page 15, would look like this: (Aitken 15).
