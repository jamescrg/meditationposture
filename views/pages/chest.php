<h1>Neutral Chest</h1>

<p>The second key component of a comfortable mediation posture is a neutral chest. This was an element of meditation posture that confused me for many years. Part of the reason for that confusion is that different posture teachers give different guidelines with regard to the chest.</p>

<p>Some meditation instructors will encourage students to “open” or “lift” or “hold up” the chest, and thereby keep it slightly raised. (Kapleau 362) Others say nothing about the chest at all, preferring instead to talk about the alignment of the hips and head. (Dogen, Sogen, Aitken) And at least some contemporary posture teachers discourage lifting the chest, preferring to keep it in a more neutral position. (Porter, Gokhale)</p>

<p>I see three ways of reconciling these differences:</p>

<ul>

<li>
First, words and images are a course method of communication in the field of posture, where we are attempting to describe and understand subtle adjusments of the internal support structures of complex human anatomy. As a result, different teachers ay have the same understanding of posture, but may use different (and possibly even contradictory) terminology in attempting to guide students toward the same end result.
</li>

Second, different teachers may be confronted with different problems. In the meditation context, when working with students who are accustomed to sitting in chairs, who are now sitting on cushions, a teacher may have to contend with a lot of slumping. As a result, the teacher becomes accustomed to instructing their students to raise up their chests. On the other hand, in a Western setting, when people in chairs attempt to correct their posture, they tend to puff out their chests and arch their backs. As a result, Western posture teachers may spend significantly more time attempting to moderate this pattern of over-correction.</p>

Third, it may be possible that zen teachers like Kapleau are overcorrecting posture when they tell students to lift the chest. This may be deliberate, for the purpose of encouraging wakefulness or a sense of confidence while meditating. Or it may be accidental. Conversely, it may be possible that posture teachers like Porter are undercorrecting their students posture, because they are accustomed to working with students who have weakened back muscles.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Ultimately, however, I don’t think it makes a huge difference whether the chest is slighlty raised or kept neutral. I personally prefer the latter approach. But you can experiment with what works best for you. One of the benefits of a meditation practice is that it gives you a lifetime of opportunity to experiement with posture. 

<p>The best and simplest advice I can give with regard to the chest is simply this. Keep the chest neutral; don’t slump down, and don’t arch up. The results should look something like the picture below.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend Porter’s and Gokhale’s books, which go into great detail on how the chest is held. Both of them are listed in my source list here.</p>
