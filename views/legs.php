<h1>Arranging the Legs</h1>

<p>The starting point to establish a good meditation posture is figuring out how to arrange your legs. This will depend largely upon how much flexibility you have in your hips. Most people in modern, Western cultures are accustomed to sitting in chairs, and therefore have lost a lot of their natural flexibility. As a result, I will first present some options for sitting in a chair before discussing more traditional meditation positions.</p>

<h2>Sitting in a Chair</h2>

<p>There is no denying that the chair is a valuable invention; its effect on human comfort and productivity has been extensive. However, the chair is also a distinctly Western innovation, and many cultures around the world still function largely without it. (Cranz 1998) Nevertheless, because it is so familiar and so ubiquitous, the chair is a logical starting point for most people.</p>

<p>There are many ways to set up a chair for mediation. Here are a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Place a zafu (a round meditation cushion, see below) on top of the seat.</li>
<li>Place a cushion behind your lower back, but below your mid-back and shoulders.</li>
<li>Place a special wedge under your tail bone to tilt your pelvis forward.</li>
<li>Fold up some towels to tilt your pelvis forward</li>
</ul>


<p> Below is a picture of a chair set up for meditation with folded towels. The bottom towel is to provide a little padding, and the top towel that is folded is there to lift the back of the pelvis.</p>

<p>We are generally advised to keep the legs at 90 degrees when sitting in a chair. This may be good advice for sitting for long periods of time for productive work while using the back rest. But it's not the optimal way to arrange the legs for meditation.</p>

<p> Instead, the thighs should be allowed to slope downward, so that the knees are below the hips. In order to make this possible, you may find it helpful to turn the thighs outward, and allow your feet to turn on their side. You may even want to cross your ankles. Here is a picture of me sitting on a chair for mediation:</p>

<h2>Seiza</h2>

<p>Another way to sit is called seiza. The word "seiza" is Japanese, and refers to a traditional way of kneeling on the floor. This is not something we do very often in the West, and we tend to find it uncomfortable on the knees, but there are several ways to reduce and even eliminate that discomfort.</p>

<p>If you have a zafu, one way to make seiza more comfortable is to place the zafu between your legs like a saddle. This arrangement allows the weight of the body to be supported by the cushion rather than the legs alone.</p>

<p>Another alternative it to purchase a small wooden bench, called a seiza bench, to put over your calves and under your bottom. The advantage of a seiza bench is that it very firmly supports the entire weight of the upper body and holds you up a little higher, and it is always the same height every time you use it (a zafu is more adjustable but less consistent).</p>

</div>

<p>Seiza is an excellent position for beginning meditators, because it promotes healthy spinal alignment. When sitting in seiza, good alignment of the lower back occurs almost without effort. </p>

<h2>Cross-legged</h2>

<p>This is the standard, familiar position for sitting on the ground. The benefit of sitting in the familiar cross-legged position is that it requires relatively little flexibility and places the weight of the body directly over the pelvis and hips. The disadvantage of sitting cross-legged is that it elevates the knees higher than the hips, which tips your weight backwards. This requires you to lean forward to maintain your balance, collapsing the lower back and bringing the shoulders slumping forward. This can be comfortable for a short time, but it will cause nagging fatigue.</p>

<p>The cross-legged posture can nevertheless be a viable position for meditation. The key is to use a cushion to elevate the hips high enough to support the natural curvature of the lumbar spine. Most online mediation supply vendors have cushions of this type. The general rule is that the hips should be higher than the knees.</p>


<h2>Burmese</h2>

<p>The Burmese posture is similar to sitting cross-legged, except that the knees are positioned more outward so that the legs do not actually overlap one another. Instead, the feet are placed one in front of the other. The shins rest on the floor. </p>

<div class="center-image"><img src="/images/sit-burmese.jpg" class="page-standard" style="border: none;"></div>

<p>Burmese requires quite a bit of flexibility in the quadriceps, and places a little more weight on the knees. A person sitting in Burmese still needs to elevate their hips to raise them above the feet and knees, which requires a little bit higher cushion. As a result, Burmese can feel a little wobbly, a little less stable than the various forms of lotus (see below).</p>

<p>The Burmese position has the advantage over cross-legged in that it brings shins down to the floor, providing some added stability. Some meditation teachers will tell students to have both knees on the floor, forming a tripod-like structure. This is useful advice, but it is actually the shins that rest on the floor. The front of the knee joint points toward the floor, but only if the cushion supporting the buttocks is high enough.</p>

<p>Burmese has the slight disadvantage of being a somewhat wide posture, especially if you have long legs. This can be a little bothersome in a meditation hall where people are sitting on either side of you. </p>

<p>I personally find it easy to over-arch the back in Burmese. Nevertheless, Burmese is a good, comfortable position, which does not demand quite as much hip flexibility as lotus. If you have trouble getting one (or both) of your knees all the way to the floor, you can place a cushion under the knee to take pressure off that leg. Most meditation supply retailers sell a variety of inexpensive support cushions for just this purpose.</p>

<h2>Quarter Lotus</h2>

<p>Similar to cross-legged, but instead of crossing the legs at the shins, one foot is placed on top of the opposite calf. Quarter lotus is a very comfortable position for people who have the requisite hip flexibility. I generally find that, when sitting on a lower cushion, I am more comfortable in quarter lotus than in Burmese. Many long-term practitioners favor quarter lotus as their mainstay sitting position. In fact, quarter lotus closely resembles the yoga posture called siddhasana or “perfect seat”. A classic fifteenth-century manual on hatha yoga, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, poses the following question: “When siddhasana is mastered, of what use are the various other postures?” (Feuerstein 63) </p>

<h2>Half Lotus</h2>

<p>Half lotus is similar to quarter lotus, but instead of placing to top foot on the opposite calf, the foot is placed on the thigh. Half lotus requires more hip flexibility, and also demands considerable flexibility from the feet. When I first started sitting in this position, I found that my top foot felt very “stretched out” after each practice session. This sensation went away after I developed some more flexibility in the front of my ankles. Now, my feet are quite comfortable in this position. It is helpful to alternate sides, sitting for one session with the right foot on top, then for the next session with the left on top.</p>

<div class="center-image"><img src="/images/sit-lotus-half-front.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

<p>One can sit in a “low” half lotus, where the foot rests on the lower thigh, or a “high” half lotus where the foot rests on the upper thigh, closer to the crease of the hip. Generally, I find that the low half lotus allows my hips to feel more level, and is generally more comfortable. A high half lotus tends to extend the gluteal muscles on the hip of the top leg, which means I have less padding on that side of my backside. This can cause me to lean slightly to one side.</p>

<p>The bottom foot can rest under the knee of the opposite leg, which means that knee of the top leg may not rest directly on the floor. This generally hasn't been a problem for me. Also, in order to make sure the knees are coming down as far as possible, it is helpful to maintain some flexibility in the quads. I generally like to tuck the bottom foot back under the top thigh, right near the front edge of my cushion, in the space between the thigh and the floor. This allows both knees to rest on the floor, and allows me to sit on a slightly lower cushion while preserving the curvature in my lower back.</p>

<h2>Full Lotus</h2>

<p>Full lotus is perhaps the most difficult meditation position for lay practitioners to attain. Unless one is sitting consistently for substantial periods of time every day, and/or doing consistent yoga to open the hips, it is difficult to attain the level of flexibility necessary for sitting in full lotus for any length of time. Even someone who can easily position themselves in lotus will be uncomfortable remaining there for ten or twenty minutes at a time, much less for hours, until they have had some time practicing in the position in order to become acclimated. Nevertheless, no discussion of meditation posture would be complete without a discussion of this iconic position.</p>

<div class="center-image"><img src="/images/sit-lotus-full.jpg" class="page-standard"></div>

<p>In full lotus, the legs are crossed at the shins with the feet placed on top of the thighs. The advantage of full lotus is that it raises the feet above the thighs, which allows the knees and thighs to rest directly on the ground. This means that very little elevation is needed to raise the seat and hips above the knees. As a result, full lotus feels compact and solid to those who are accustomed to sitting that way. Sitting on a lower cushion also allows the hands to rest more easily and securely in the lap, again improving the solidity of the posture. Also, for physiological reasons that I don't fully understand, full lotus provides amazing support for the lower back. Perhaps this is why full lotus is favored by zen monks, who sit in meditation for long hours each day.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are thousands of long-term meditation practitioners who cannot sit in full lotus, and have no special desire to make the attempt. Conversely, there are also athletes and dancers who can attain the lotus position with little difficulty, but who have little interest in or experience with meditation and exhibit few of the qualities of a skilled practitioner in meditation. For someone who is new to the practice of meditation, trying to sit in full lotus is more likely to be a distraction and obstacle to the enjoyment of their practice, if not a cause of injury.</p>

<p> The important thing is to find a way of arranging the legs that works for the individual practitioner. Over time, it may be possible to develop the ability to sit comfortably in various forms of lotus. However, one should avoid the notion that there are more or less advanced sitting postures. The advanced sitting posture is the one that allows you to find comfort and minimize distraction. Nevertheless, if you absolutely must make the attempt, be my guest. As one of my teachers once said, "I have no problem getting into full lotus. I just can't get out."</p>
